# TensorFlow_Demo
Classifier which recognizes handwritten characters using [MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Instruction how to install TensorFlow can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

Repository contains following files:
* `board.py` and `input_data.py` - implementation of neural network with one hidden layer of 784 neurons using
TensorFlow. Achieved classification error: **1.6%**. Example output of the classification:

* `TensorFlow_test.py` - test if TensorFlow was installed correctly.
* `CPU_GPU.py` - example of how to control the program execution - CPU vs. GPU.
* `one_neuron.py` - very simple example of learning the network of only one neuron. Start with it if you are new to TensorFlow.
